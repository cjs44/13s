## Caitlin Smith - csmith44

In order to run my Assignment 0 program, start with *clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -o hello hello.c*. Then enter *./hello*. This will result in "Hello World!" being printed to the standard output.<br>

**Files**<br>
*hello.c* contains the program for Hello World.<br>
*CHEATING.pdf* is the submission of the cheating agreement.<br>
*essay.pdf* is an essay on “Censorship and Silence” by Umberto Eco.<br>
*README.md* contains the steps to run the program and descriptions of the files pushed to git.<br>
