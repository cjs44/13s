# README Assignment 1
## Caitlin Smith - csmith44 - 1/20/23

In order to run my Assignment 1 program, download the files and run *./plot.sh*. This will produce two different pdfs of plots.<br>

**Files**<br>
*plot.sh* contains the bash script that uses monte\_carlo.c to generate data and gnuplot to produce plots<br>
*monte_carlo.c* contains the implementation of the Monte Carlo method<br>
*Makefile* contains what is needed to clear and recompile<br>
*README.md* describes how to run the program and details components of it<br>
*DESIGN.pdf* describes the design and process enough to be replicated<br>
*WRITEUP.pdf* includes the necessary analysis of the program<br>

**Resources**<br>
I attended Dev Purandareâ€™s section on January 17th and took notes on gnuplot objects, using awk to print specific columns, set key autotitle, and setting the plot size to a square. I used these for my plot.sh program. I looked at the man pages for the gnuplot color palette and xtics.
